Look	if	you	had	one	shot	or	one	opportunity
To	seize	everything	you	ever	wanted	in	one	moment
Would	you	capture	it	or	just	let	it	slip	Yo
His	palms	are	sweaty	knees	weak	arms	are	heavy
There	is	vomit	on	his	sweater	already	mom's	spaghetti
He	is	nervous	but	on	the	surface	he	looks	calm	and	ready
To	drop	bombs	but	he	keeps	on	forgetting
What	he	wrote	down	the	whole	crowd	goes	so	loud
He	opens	his	mouth	but	the	words	won't	come	out
He	is	choking	how	Everybody	is	joking	now
The	clock	is run	out	time	is	up	over	blaow
Snap	back	to	reality	ope	there	goes	gravity	ope
There	goes	Rabbit	he	choked	he	is	so	mad	but	he	won't
Give	up	that	easy	no	he	won't	have	it	he	knows
His	whole	back	is	to	these	ropes	it	don't	matter	he	is	dope
He	knows	that	but	he	is	broke	he	is	so	stagnant	he	knows
When	he	goes	back	to	this	mobile	home	that	is	when	it	is
Back	to	the	lab	again	yo	this	old	rhapsody
Better	go	capture	this	moment	and	hope	it	don't	pass	him	and
You	better	lose	yourself	in	the	music
The	moment	you	own	it	you	better	never	let	it	go	Go
You	only	get	one	shot	do	not	miss	your	chance	to	blow
This	opportunity	comes	once	in	a	lifetime	yo
You	better	lose	yourself	in	the	music
The	moment	you	own	it	you	better	never	let	it	go	Go
You	only	get	one	shot	do	not	miss	your	chance	to	blow
This	opportunity	comes	once	in	a	lifetime	yo
You	better
